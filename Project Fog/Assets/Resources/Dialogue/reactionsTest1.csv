Hm this one is growing nicely ,Koi,Koi_ArmForward,,None,,,,,,Koi Move 2,,,,,Koi Shocked
Er…you think so?,Gravel,Gravel_Idle,,,,,,,,Gravel Move 4,,,,,
Positive.,Koi,Koi_HappyArmup,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"You seem to always win this competition, so I guess there’s no need to worry.",Gravel,Gravel_ThumbsUp,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Koi Shocked, Gravel Shocked"
That’s because I put my all into it.,Koi,Koi_ArmsDownHappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mmh. You’re not wrong bout that.,Gravel,Gravel_ProudHappyEyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just needs a bit more limestone to keep the PH balance of the soil in check and I think that’s it.,Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aren’t you overdoing it a bit mate? I’m sure the PH levels are stable enough to last you a few hours and the bags of limestone are massive and weigh a ton.,Gravel,Gravel_ArmsCrossed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I’m not taking any chances. ,Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Ah these are quite heavy),Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mate, those are too heavy for yah, come on let’s get the lift.",Gravel,Gravel_SlightAnger,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nah I got this. See, not a problem.",Koi,Koi_ArmForward,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see. Remind me to call you next time I need a mountain moved.,Gravel,Gravel_Idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anyways let me just finish this.,Koi,Koi_ArmForwardOh,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oi! Koi! Remind me again why you got these toxic weeds growing in here.,Gravel,Gravel_ThinkingLookingAway,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You mean phytotoxins? I’m growing them here for research purposes. It’s convenient. Plus I’ve heard you can make medicine from them with your talents. It's perfect.,Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I know that. It’s just I’m not used to working with them before the drying process. It’s too risky having it out in the open. What with the toxic fumes… and wot bout the kid?,Gravel,Gravel_Idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Iris? What about her?,Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Well…aren’t you afraid she might just waltz in, pluck it and stick it in her hair or somethin’",Gravel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well she knows better not to enter here. Plus ... she told me she doesn’t like how controlled and organized it is. Says it’s not natural and prefers her plants to be “free range”.,Koi,Koi_ArmsDownHappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right.,Gravel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah and if she did, the anti venoms you made before will be handy. Crisis averted basically.",Koi,Koi_ArmForwardOh,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That stuff isn’t easy to make you know. Don’t go around handing it out like candy. Top of that she shouldn’t have to experience that in the first place…,Gravel,Gravel_SlightAnger,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 What’s the matter Gravel? You never showed this much concern before. I thought you worked with poisonous plants all the time.,Koi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It’s nothing really, it was just easier to manage this because it was just us and our skills. Now that you agree to have the kid here worryin’ bout her safety has been on my mind yah know.",Gravel,Gravel_Idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You’re overthinking it too much. She’s tough and smart to handle it.,Koi,Koi_ArmsDownHappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you say so mate…,Gravel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Koi! Gravel!,Iris,Iris_Idle,,,,,,,,Iris Move 5,,,,,
Speaking of the little squirt.,Gravel,Gravel_ProudHappyEyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hey Iris, leaving already?",Koi,Koi_ArmForwardOh,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes. I am doing what the people call “hanging with the friends”.,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That’s good, have fun alright.",Koi,Koi_HappyArmup,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And be safe! Also there’s some construction going on the main road, I don’t want you hanging around there alright! It’s no place for kids.",Gravel,Gravel_Idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Understood. I have been having a thought lately. The colorful paper outside and banners on your home’s walls is something happening?,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oh, I thought maybe your friends would have filled you in by now. Basically every year this month, Oceanside has an annual flower festival.",Koi,Koi_ArmForwardOh,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It’s supposed to be 'bout remembrance of someone, but folks mostly care about the contest anyways.",Gravel,Gravel_ArmsCrossed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contest you say?,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah. It’s a contest to see who can grow the most exotic plant from home. The judges are strict and each year it gets more and more competitive.,Koi,Koi_ThinkingArmsCrossed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh. Will you be entering?,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yup, in my case I chose a flower that reminds me of my Mom. She had a whole field of these back when she was still with us.",Koi,Koi_ArmsDownHappy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I see. It is beautiful.,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Koi always wins anyways. And the prize this time will be a boat ride to anywhere around the island. We’re going to take it to explore some of the uninhabited nearby islands by the coast.,Gravel,Gravel_ThinkingHappyEyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You’re talking as if you’ve won it already.,Koi,Koi_HappyArmup,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This sounds very fun. I am quite er…interested?,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come by the plaza later today.,Koi,Koi_ArmForward,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh looks like my friends have arrived.,Iris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
